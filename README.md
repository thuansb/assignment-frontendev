### The time spent: about 5 hours

### Run the app:
* npm install
* npm start
* Go to: localhost:4000
* Note: because the app use some dummy data to test (not get data from server), so once data change locally, it may not consistent between pages.

### Some features have completed:
* Handle Login/Logout, ask for login before navigate to a page, after login successfully redirect to that page.
* Handle navigation between pages, store navigation history using react-router
* Add user/remove user
* Show details information of user

### The feature has not completed yet:
create group, add user to group
* Reason: I don't have much time cause I'm too busy with my current job. So I decided to stop here.

### Technologies
* ReactJS
* React-router
* Bootstrap
* Only using bootstrap, not use any other library for table
